Playing around project of november-december 2023

Predators Eat Prey to make energy
prey eat predator carcasses for energy.
They can also build barriers after consuming carcasses.
Predators eventually make mushrooms which breed more predators.
prey can create cities and a ufo for defence.

Inspured By The old simpsons episode where Lisas Tooth Became an entire civilization.
